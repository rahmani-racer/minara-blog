    <section class="intro"><h3>Problem-based introduction</h3>
    <p>Level drawing inconsistent lagti hai beginners ko. Is guide mein simple rules for drawing support and resistance, confirmation methods, and GOLD examples diye gaye hain.</p></section>

    <section><h3>Step-by-step explanation</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Identify recent swing highs and lows on higher timeframe.</li>
      <li>Prefer round-number and visible reaction levels.</li>
      <li>Validate with multiple touches and volume confirmation.</li>
    </ol></section>

    <section><h3>What Are Support and Resistance Really? (Trading Psychology)</h3>
    <p>Support = price level where buyers step in (price bounces). Resistance = price level where sellers step in (price bounces). Why? Traders remember old levels. If EURUSD bounced at 1.1000 three times, traders expect bounce there again. They buy near 1.1000, creating demand, preventing break. This collective psychology = support level.</p>
    <p><strong>Types of Support/Resistance:</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Swing High/Low:</strong> Previous recent local high (resistance) or low (support). Most traders watch these. Price bounces off last week's high = resistance.</li>
      <li><strong>Round Numbers:</strong> 2100 GOLD, 1.1000 EUR/USD. Psychological levels traders anticipate. Spreads often widen near round numbers (sellers anticipating rejection).</li>
      <li><strong>Moving Averages:</strong> 20MA, 50MA, 100MA, 200MA. Act as dynamic support (price bounces off them in trending markets).</li>
      <li><strong>Confluence Zones:</strong> Where multiple levels meet. Example: Daily 20MA + weekly support + round number 2100 all at GOLD 2100. This is a strong confluence zone (80%+ probability bounce).</li>
    </ol>
    </section>

    <section><h3>How To Identify Strong vs Weak Support/Resistance</h3>
    <p><strong>Strong Level (Trade With Confidence):</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Price has touched 3+ times (proven support, not random).</li>
      <li>Touches are spread over time (not 3 touches in 1 day; spread over weeks = more valid).</li>
      <li>Volume at level is high (many trades = strong buyer/seller interest).</li>
      <li>Confluence present (MA + swing + round number all at same level).</li>
      <li>Daily timeframe level (not just 5M noise).</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> GOLD has bounced at 2100 on: (1) Weekly chart, (2) Daily 20MA, (3) Previous swing high, (4) Round number. Four confluences = high-probability support. 65-75% bounce rate.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Weak Level (Avoid or Be Cautious):</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Price touched only 1-2 times (could be random).</li>
      <li>All touches within 1 week (not proven over time).</li>
      <li>Volume low at level (few participants care).</li>
      <li>No confluence (just a single S/R line, no supporting structure).</li>
      <li>5M timeframe only (noise, not real structure).</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> GOLD level at 2085 touched only once last month, no confluence. This is weak support. 45-50% bounce rate. Skip or reduce size.</p>
    </section>

    <section><h3>Drawing Levels (Practical Rules)</h3>
    <p><strong>Rule 1: Use Swing Highs/Lows from Higher Timeframes</strong></p>
    <p>Daily chart: Find swing high (peak) and swing low (valley) over recent weeks. Draw horizontal lines through these. These are your prime S/R levels. Avoid drawing lines on 1M intraday swings (too much noise).</p>
    <p><strong>Rule 2: Mark Levels Clean, Not Exact Pips</strong></p>
    <p>If daily swing high is at 2105-2107, mark zone as 2105-2110 (not precise 2106.5). Price rarely bounces EXACTLY at one pip. Use zones (10 pip range) not exact lines.</p>
    <p><strong>Rule 3: Timeframe Alignment is Critical</strong></p>
    <p>If daily resistance at 2100 and 4H resistance at 2095, they're different. Use daily (2100) for your bias, 4H (2095) for entry timing. If daily shows breakout likely, sell setup at 4H 2095 resistance.</p>
    <p><strong>Rule 4: Mark Only The Most Important Levels</strong></p>
    <p>Marking 10 levels on chart = confusion. Mark maximum 3-4: (1) Weekly major support, (2) Daily support/resistance, (3) One confluence zone. Clean chart = clear decision-making.</p>
    </section>

    <section><h3>Trading Off Support/Resistance (Practical Setups)</h3>
    <p><strong>Setup 1: Buy Near Support (Bullish Bias)</strong></p>
    <p>Daily 200MA is rising (bullish). Price pulls down to weekly support at 2100. You DON'T buy at 2100 immediately. Wait for: (1) Price to bounce off 2100 (candle close above 2100), (2) Volume spike on bounce, (3) Bullish confirmation candle. THEN enter long. Stop: 20 pips below support. Target: Next resistance. Probability: 60-70%.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Setup 2: Resistance Rejection (Bearish Setup)</strong></p>
    <p>Daily trend is down. Price rallies to daily resistance 2120. You see: (1) Price touches 2120 (resistance), (2) Rejection candle (long wick at top, small body). (3) Volume spike on rejection. Enter short from 2120. Stop: Above 2120. Target: Previous support. Probability: 55-65%.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Setup 3: Confluence Zone Bounce (High Probability)</strong></p>
    <p>Daily 50MA + previous swing low + round number all at 2100. This is confluence. Price approaches 2100, you don't question it. Wait for bounce confirmation and enter long aggressively (smaller stop = higher reward). Probability: 70-80% (strongest setup due to confluence).</p>
    </section>

    <section><h3>Real trading logic (GOLD example)</h3>
    <p>Buy near support when higher timeframe trend is bullish; stop below level and target next resistance. For XAU/USD, look at weekly/monthly levels for major bias.</p></section>

    <p>Annotated levels on GOLD daily chart.</p></section>

    <section><h3>Common Mistakes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Drawing too many levels—stick to a few clear ones.</strong> Chart littered with 15 levels = no clarity. Mark only strong ones (3+ touches, confluence). Fewer levels = better decisions.</li>
      <li><strong>Not considering timeframe alignment.</strong> You mark 4H resistance but daily trend is bullish through that level. Conflicting signals. Check daily bias BEFORE marking levels.</li>
    </ul></section>

    <section><h3>Pro Tips</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Mark only levels that have multiple reactions and are visible across timeframes.</strong> If level visible on 4H and weekly both = strong level. If visible only on 1H = weak. Cross-timeframe validation is key.</li>
      <li><strong>Use confluence (round number + moving average + fib) for stronger confidence.</strong> Single level bounce = 50-60% win. Three confluences at one level = 70-80% win. Confluence stacking beats single levels.</li>
    </ul></section>

    <section><h3>SEO FAQs</h3>
    <dl>
      <dt>1. Support/resistance level drawing ka best method?</dt>
      <dd>Simple: (1) Identify recent swing highs/lows on daily chart. (2) Draw horizontal zone (not exact line) through these. (3) Check for confluence (MA, round number, previous reaction). (4) Mark only strong ones (3+ touches or high confluence).</dd>
      <dt>2. Levels safe guarantee dete hain bounce?</dt>
      <dd>No. Level with 3+ touches = 60-65% bounce probability. With confluence = 70-80%. But 20-30% failure chance always exists. Use stops always. Don't assume guaranteed bounce.</dd>
      <dt>3. Round number support vs MA support: Kaunsa important?</dt>
      <dd>Both matter. Round number 2100 = psychological (traders expect rejection). 20MA = dynamic, mechanical (follows price). Strong when both align at same level. Example: GOLD at 2100 AND 20MA at 2100 = 75% bounce. Just 2100 alone = 55-60% bounce.</dd>
      <dt>4. Level kab break hona, kab hold: Pata chalega kaise?</dt>
      <dd>Volume is key. (1) High volume at level = strong support (likely hold). (2) Low volume at level = weak (likely break). (3) Volume spike on approach = breakout coming (break likely). Check volume before entering trade.</dd>
      <dt>5. Support rejection vs support break: Difference kya?</dt>
      <dd><strong>Rejection:</strong> Price touches support, bounces up (bulls defend, no breakdown). <strong>Break:</strong> Price closes below support + volume (bulls fail, sellers win). Rejection = buy setup. Break = sell setup. Candle close determines which.</dd>
      <dt>6. Daily support vs weekly support: Kaunsa important?</dt>
      <dd>Weekly > daily (more timeframe = more players involved = stronger). If daily support breaks but weekly holds, likely bounce at weekly. Weekly levels are "major floors," daily levels are "minor stops." Trade respects weekly over daily.</dd>
      <dt>7. Confluence example: Kaunsa 3 things align hote?</dt>
      <dd>(1) Previous swing high, (2) Daily 50MA, (3) Round number. Example: EURUSD swing high 1.1050 + 50MA at 1.1050 + round 1.1050 = confluence. 75%+ bounce at this level. Three confluences = very high probability = wider stop OK.</dd>
      <dt>8. Agar level break ho to next support kaunsa?</dt>
      <dd>Look lower: Previous swing low or 200MA often act as next support. Keep levels marked on chart. When one breaks, next is already identified. Chain of levels = "support ladder" down. Trend follows this ladder.</dd>
      <dt>9. GOLD specific: 50-pip levels vs 100-pip levels?</dt>
      <dd>GOLD is volatile. 100-pip level zones more valid than 50-pip (less noise). Example: 2100-2110 zone > 2095-2100. Adjust zones for volatility.</dd>
      <dt>10. Live support/resistance: How often redraw?</dt>
      <dd>Daily levels: Update when price makes new swing (1-2x per week). Weekly levels: Rarely change (major structure, stable). Don't redraw because "price is near level." Only add NEW levels when clear new swing forms. Keep history of old levels for context.</dd>
