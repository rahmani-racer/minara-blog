      <h3>Step-by-step explanation</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Market ka basic:</strong> Forex is a global market where currencies are bought and sold. Example pair: XAU/USD (Gold priced in USD).</li>
        <li><strong>Currency pair:</strong> First symbol is base (XAU), second is quote (USD). A price 1950.00 means 1 ounce of gold = $1950.</li>
        <li><strong>Buy vs Sell:</strong> If you expect GOLD to rise, you buy (long). Expect fall → sell (short).</li>
        <li><strong>Lot size & Leverage:</strong> Brokers offer lot sizes and leverage; understand margin before trading.</li>
        <li><strong>Order types:</strong> Market, limit, stop — use stop-loss to control risk.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Real trading logic (GOLD example)</h3>
      <p>
        Suppose XAU/USD is trading at 1950.50. A simple swing-trade logic:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Identify trend on daily chart — price above 50 EMA = bullish bias.</li>
        <li>Wait for a retracement to a support zone near 1938–1945 (measured using recent swings).</li>
        <li>Place a limit buy at 1942 with stop-loss at 1928 (14 points below entry) and target at 1974 (32 points reward) — this gives ~2.3:1 risk-reward.</li>
        <li>Position sizing: risk 1% of account. If account = $2000, 1% = $20 allowed risk. With stop 14 points (14 * pip value), calculate lot size accordingly (see Position Sizing article).
      </ol>

      <h3>Image-based examples (mandatory)</h3>
      <p>Below is an example chart snapshot showing the retracement and entry area. (Example image, annotate in editor for production.)</p>

      <p>Image explanation: green box = support, arrow = ideal entry, red line = stop-loss, blue = take-profit.</p>

      <h3>Common Mistakes</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Over-leveraging: chhota account + high leverage = fast losses.</li>
        <li>No stop-loss: leaving trades unprotected invites big drawdowns.</li>
        <li>Chasing entries: entering after big moves instead of waiting for structured setup.</li>
        <li>Ignoring spread and trading costs — GOLD spreads can widen during news.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Pro Tips</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Use higher timeframe to define trend, lower timeframe to time entries.</li>
        <li>Prefer cleaner charts — remove too many indicators; price action clarity helps.</li>
        <li>Practice on demo for several months before going live.</li>
        <li>Keep a trading journal; record entries, reasoning, outcome.</li>
      </ul>
