  <h1>Forex Trading — A Practical Guide (English + Hinglish)</h1>

  <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br>
  The forex market (foreign exchange) is the largest financial market in the world — daily volume runs into trillions. Yeh market currencies ke pairs me trade hota hai: one currency is bought while another is sold. Banks, institutions, corporations and retail traders all participate. Forex runs 24 hours a day on business days across global sessions, which creates continuous opportunity and continuous risk. This guide gives you a practical roadmap — basics, analysis, risk control and a simple action plan. Mix of English + Hinglish to keep it friendly and usable.</p>

  <h2>How the Forex Market Works</h2>
  <p>Forex is decentralized and operates through interbank networks and broker platforms. Trades happen in pairs like <em>EUR/USD</em>, <em>USD/JPY</em>, <em>GBP/USD</em>. Price represents how much of the quote currency is needed to buy one unit of the base currency. Small moves measured in pips can mean real profit or loss depending on position size. Market participants include central banks, commercial banks, hedge funds, exporters/importers, and retail traders.</p>

  <h2>Currency Pairs, Pip & Lots</h2>
  <p>Currency pairs are categorized into majors (EUR/USD, USD/JPY), minors (EUR/GBP), and exotics (USD/TRY). Pip is the smallest standard price movement — commonly 0.0001 for most pairs. Trade size is in lots (micro, mini, standard); ek pip ka value lot size par depend karta hai. Position sizing hi sabse important part hai — bina proper size calculate kiye trade karna gambling jaisa hai.</p>

  <h2>Trading Sessions & Liquidity</h2>
  <p>Forex trading is split across three major sessions: Asian, London, and New York. London session often brings the biggest moves and liquidity. The overlap between London and New York is the most liquid. Apne timezone ke hisaab se session samajh lo — agar aap India se trade kar rahe ho to London session mornings me active rahega.</p>

  <h2>Leverage — Double-Edged Sword</h2>
  <p>Leverage allows control of a big position with small capital (e.g., 1:50, 1:100). Yeh profit amplify karta hai, but losses bhi amplify hote hain. Use low leverage until you consistently produce positive expectancy. Always know your margin requirements and never let margin calls surprise you.</p>

  <h2>Two Approaches: Fundamental & Technical</h2>
  <p><strong>Fundamental analysis</strong> studies interest rates, GDP, employment, and central bank policy. These drive medium-term currency trends. <strong>Technical analysis</strong> uses price action, support/resistance, trends, chart patterns and indicators to time entries. Best practice: use both — tools ko combine kar ke better probability create hoti hai.</p>

  <h2>Risk Management — The Real Edge</h2>
  <p>Protecting capital is more important than chasing returns. Kuch practical rules:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Risk only a small percentage of account per trade (commonly 1% or less for beginners).</li>
    <li>Always use stop-loss. No exceptions.</li>
    <li>Calculate position size from stop distance and maximum risk amount.</li>
    <li>Maintain favourable risk/reward (e.g., 1:2 minimum).</li>
    <li>Limit correlated exposures — don’t risk several trades that move together.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Simple Trade Plan (Step-by-step)</h2>
  <p>1) Decide session and pairs you will trade. 2) Use higher-timeframe to find trend/bias (daily/4H). 3) Wait for a pattern or pullback on your trading timeframe (1H/15m). 4) Enter with stop under logical level and position sized to risk limit. 5) Place target and manage trade (partial take-profit / trailing stop). Yeh process discipline deta hai — emotions kam rahenge.</p>

  <h2>Common Mistakes & How to Avoid</h2>
  <p>Over-leveraging, trading news without plan, no stop-loss, and revenge trading are the main killers. Avoid: chasing every signal, trading too many pairs, and changing strategy after a few losers. Instead maintain a trading journal — track reasons, entry/exit, and lessons.</p>

  <h2>Psychology & Discipline</h2>
  <p>Profit consistency comes from process, not from one big winning trade. Emotions like fear and greed destroy accounts. Set rules, follow them, and accept small controlled losses. Ek rule: if you break your own rules, stop trading for the day and review before re-entering.</p>

  <h2>Practical Examples (mini-checklist)</h2>
  <p>- Bullish trend: wait for pullback to support, look for bullish price action (pin bar/engulfing) on 1H, enter with stop below recent low. <br>
  - Range: trade support-resistance bounces with tight stops and small size. <br>
  - News: reduce size or avoid; volatility spikes can trip stops and create slippage.</p>

  <h2>Resources & Tools</h2>
  <p>Use a reliable economic calendar, a demo account for practice, and a broker with transparent execution. Keep learning and review monthly performance metrics — win rate, average R:R, expectancy, and max drawdown.</p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Forex trading is a skill built over time: knowledge + practice + discipline. Start small, focus on risk management, and develop a repeatable process. Agar aap consistent ho aur capital protect karte ho, market aapko reward karega. Start with demo, master your edge, then scale gradually.</p>
