      <h2>What Are Pips and Pip Value</h2>

    <section class="intro">
      <h3>Problem-based introduction</h3>
      <p>
        New traders ask: "Pips kya hote hain aur pip value kaise calculate karein?" Without this, risk calculations and profit targets will be incorrect. This article explains pips, pip value, and how to calculate for GOLD (XAU/USD) and currency pairs.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Step-by-step explanation</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Definition:</strong> A pip is the smallest price increment for a given instrument (for many pairs it's 0.0001; for XAU/USD, brokers often use 0.01 or 0.1 depending on pricing).</li>
        <li><strong>Calculate pip value:</strong> Pip value = (pip size / price) * lot size * conversion. Use broker contract specs for GOLD.</li>
        <li><strong>Examples:</strong> For 1 standard lot in a currency pair, a pip may equal $10; for GOLD, pip value per contract depends on oz size.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Real trading logic (GOLD example)</h3>
      <p>
        If broker contract = 1 oz/lot and XAU/USD moves 1.00 USD, pip value = $1 per lot (example). If stop-loss is 15.00 points, risk = 15 * $1 = $15 for 1 lot. Understanding this deeply is crucial. Aapke account pe stop-loss set karte waqt, aapko exact rupay mein kितना loss hoga ye maloom hona chahiye. Agar aap 10 lots trade kar rahe ho aur per-lot risk Rs. 1000 hai, to total risk = Rs. 10,000. Ye discipline se pehle calculate karna zaroori hai. Joh traders pips samajh nahi paate, woh blind ho kar trading karte hain — aur blind traders jo result dete hain, woh alag kharab hote hain.
      </p>
      
      <h4>Advanced Pip Concepts</h4>
      <p>
        Pips vary by instrument class. Stocks move in pennies, forex pairs in pips (0.0001 for most), commodities in their own tick structures. GOLD (XAU/USD) traditionally quoted in 0.01 increments (cents per ounce), but some brokers quote in 0.1 or smaller. The key is to always check your broker's contract specifications before entering any trade. Many retail traders make catastrophic mistakes because they assume all instruments have the same pip structure — they don't.
      </p>
      
      <h4>Pip Value Across Different Account Currencies</h4>
      <p>
        Your trading account currency matters. If your account is in INR but you trade EUR/USD, pip values need conversion. Example: 1 pip in EUR/USD might equal $10 if lot = 1 standard. But your account is INR. Current rate (example) INR/USD = 83, so pip value in INR = $10 * 83 = Rs. 830 per pip. This is where many traders slip up — they calculate in USD but their account drawdown is in INR, leading to mental mismatch. Agar aap India mein ho aur INR account mein trade kar rahe ho, to pip value ko always INR mein sochna padega.
      </p>
      
      <h4>Why Understanding Pip Value Prevents Blowouts</h4>
      <p>
        Imagine you risk 10 pips on a trade thinking it's "small." But if your per-pip cost is Rs. 5,000 (high leverage, large lot), then 10 pips = Rs. 50,000 loss. Aapka account jab blow out hota hai, mostly yeh reason hota hai — pip value samajh nahi, size overdo kar diya. Discipline ke pehle pip value suddhi samajhni zaroori hai. Once you know exact pip cost, position sizing becomes mechanical: if account = Rs. 1,00,000 aur aap 1% risk lena chahte ho (Rs. 1,000), aur pip value = Rs. 500, to aap sirf 2 pips stop-loss le sakte ho with 1 lot. Aur agar aapko 20 pips stop-loss chahiye, to size 1/10 lot hona chahiye.

      <h3>Common Mistakes</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Using wrong pip size for instruments:</strong> Gold vs currency pairs differ. One pip for EUR/USD is 0.0001, but for GOLD it may be 0.01 or 0.1 depending on broker. Assume nothing—verify with your broker always.</li>
        <li><strong>Forgetting to convert pip value to account currency:</strong> If your account is INR and you trade USD pairs, pip value calculated in USD must be converted to INR using current exchange rate.</li>
        <li><strong>Confusing pips with points:</strong> Some brokers and platforms use "points" instead of pips. Clarify with your broker whether 1 point = 1 pip or if they differ (common in some MT5 setups).</li>
        <li><strong>Not calculating pip value BEFORE entering a trade:</strong> Many traders enter, then wonder what the risk is. Calculate first, always.</li>
        <li><strong>Over-leveraging because "pip cost is small":</strong> Sahi lag sakta hai ki per pip aapka sirf Rs. 100 kharch hota hai, lekin agar aap 50 lot trade karte ho, to 1 pip = Rs. 5,000. Leverage ki baat mein zaroori nahi ki badi lot lo — sirf kuch pips mein account wipe ho sakta hai.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Pip Value Calculator (Manual Formula)</h3>
      <p>
        Use this formula to calculate pip value for any instrument:
      </p>
      <pre style="background:#071022;color:#38bdf8;padding:12px;border-radius:6px;overflow-x:auto;font-size:12px;">
Pip Value = (Pip Size / Current Price) × Lot Size × Exchange Rate
      </pre>
      <p>
        <strong>Example for GOLD (XAU/USD) with standard assumptions:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Pip Size: 0.01 (1 cent per ounce)</li>
        <li>Current Price: 1950 USD</li>
        <li>Lot Size: 1 standard lot = 100 ounces</li>
        <li>Pip Value = (0.01 / 1950) × 100 × 1 = Rs. 0.513 approximately</li>
        <li>If your account is in INR (exchange rate 83 INR/USD), Pip Value in INR ≈ Rs. 42.60 per pip</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Note: Exact calculations depend on broker contract specifications. Always use your broker's documentation to confirm lot size and pip definitions.

      <h3>Real Trader Scenario: How Pip Value Shapes Risk Management</h3>
      <p>
        Let's take a real scenario. Rahul has a Rs. 5,00,000 account and wants to trade EUR/USD with 1% risk rule (Rs. 5,000 per trade). EUR/USD is trading at 1.0900. For standard lots, 1 pip in EUR/USD = approximately $10 = Rs. 830 (at INR/USD = 83). If Rahul places a stop-loss of 50 pips from entry, his risk would be 50 × Rs. 830 = Rs. 41,500 — way above the 1% limit. So he must reduce lot size. If he trades 0.1 lot (micro lot), then risk = 0.1 × 50 × Rs. 830 = Rs. 4,150, which is under his 1% budget. This is discipline in action: pip value calculation → position sizing → risk management. Ek bhi step miss hona sakta hai account blow-out ki wajah. Rahul ne apne trading plan mein likha hai: "Pehle pip value, phir lot size, phir trade karo." Issi order ko follow karte ho, to risk controlled rahega.

      <h3>Pro Tips</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a spreadsheet for quick calculations:</strong> Create a simple Excel or Google Sheets file with columns for instrument, price, lot size, and auto-calculate pip value. Even 30 seconds of prep avoids costly mistakes.</li>
        <li><strong>Leverage broker calculators:</strong> Most brokers provide pip value or position size calculators built into their platforms (MT4, MT5, cTrader). Use them — they're accurate and eliminate human error.</li>
        <li><strong>Test on demo accounts first:</strong> Before live trading, practice on demo using the actual lot sizes you plan to trade. Watch how P&L moves with pips and get a feel for real risk.</li>
        <li><strong>Set pip-based stop-losses and take-profits:</strong> Instead of saying "stop at 1950," say "stop at 15 pips below entry." This forces you to think in terms of defined risk, not just price levels.</li>
        <li><strong>Review pip value monthly:</strong> If exchange rates move (like INR/USD), your pip values in local currency change. Recalculate to ensure position sizes still match your 1% risk rule.</li>
        <li><strong>Never assume pip sizes across platforms:</strong> MetaTrader 4, cTrader, and some brokers quote instruments differently. Always check the contract specs in your platform.</li>
        <li><strong>Fractional pips (4-5 decimal places):</strong> Some forex brokers quote to 5 decimals (e.g., 1.09005 instead of 1.0900). One \"pipette\" = 1/10 of a pip. Tighter pricing but potential slippage. Know your broker's convention.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Hidden Pip Costs: Spreads, Commissions & Slippage</h3>
      <p>Pip value calculations tell you theoretical loss on a move. But three hidden costs erode your edge: (1) <strong>Spread:</strong> EUR/USD bid-ask spread = 1-2 pips. Every entry you pay spread immediately. (2) <strong>Commission:</strong> ECN brokers charge per-lot commission (e.g., $5 per lot = ~0.5 pips on majors). (3) <strong>Slippage:</strong> During news or low liquidity, your actual fill may be 5-20 pips worse than expected. Example: You want to buy EUR/USD at 1.0900, actual fill = 1.0910 (10 pips slippage). Total cost per entry = spread + commission + slippage = 3-25 pips in worst case. This is why many traders break-even or lose even with 55% win-rate — costs eat profits. Solution: factor these hidden costs into your target calculations. If pip value = Rs. 500, and you expect 5 pips of hidden costs per trade, that's Rs. 2,500 cost per entry. Add to your loss budget or increase winning trade targets. Professional traders always account for real execution costs, not theoretical pip movements.</p>
    </section>
      <p>
        Discipline starts with habits. Every single trade, before you click "Buy" or "Sell," ask yourself: "Kitni pips mera stop-loss away hai? Ek pip ki cost kya hai? Total risk kitna hoga?" Ek trader joh ye tino questions puchta hai aur documented answer dekta hai, woh 90% safer hota hai compared to traders who wing it. Make pip calculation part of your pre-trade checklist — even faster than reading news, because risk is everything. Ek trade mein Rs. 10,000 jhata hai aur aapka account khatam. But calculated risk wali trading slowly aur surely wealth build karti hai.
